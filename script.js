I donâ€™t really know where to begin, because no words could ever match how I feel about youâ€¦ but Iâ€™ll try anyway.

How are you, pretty baby? Have I already told you today that I love everything about you?

And when I say everything, I mean everything from your skin to your pure soul. Even the parts of yourself you donâ€™t like... I love those too.

The things you see as flaws I see as beautiful pieces of the person I adore.

I love you the way the moon loves to show up in every phase: half, quarter, or full.

That means I love every version of youâ€”even the darker sides. And Iâ€™ll be here through all of it.

I want to give you all that I have, even when you're not at your best.

And in your full moon phase, when youâ€™re feeling your fullest and brightestâ€”I want to be there, cheering you on, building dreams with you, and celebrating every moment until the hard days finally pay off.

I want you to always remember where you came fromâ€”to look back and reflect on how much you've grown along the way.

And most of all, I want to walk beside you through it allâ€”every step, every season, every chapter.

Youâ€™ll never be alone, baby. Iâ€™m yours completely. Always. 

I love you endlessly. ðŸ«¶ðŸŒ™
